# The Route
This is a route for the Breath of the Wild 100% speedrun, based on the original "Granatus" route by Johnnyboomr and updated and worked on by the speedrun community. It includes updates related to the major glitches: item duplcation, item transmutation, memory corruption.

This version has been modified for using standard movements (no movement-based glitches such as windbomb, BLSS, or BTB). The route is intended to prioritize the following assumptions:
- Champions' Ballad will be completed in the early game.
- Epona will be used in the early game, and then the Master Cycle Zero.
- At least two giant ancient cores will be obtained so that an ancient bow and ancient shield can be purchased.
- Hylian Shield durability will be transferred to the ancient shield.
- Corrputed items will be: Rushroom, Wood, Ancient Cores, Beetles, Opal, Lizalfos Tails, and Hearty Bass.
