# The Route
This is a route for the Breath of the Wild 100% speedrun, based on the original "Granatus" route by Johnnyboomr and updated and worked on by the speedrun community. It includes updates related to the major glitches: inventory slot transfer (IST), direct inventory corruption (DIC), invalid star tab, hold prompt entanglement (HPE), and weapon modifier corruption (WMC).

This version has been modified for using standard movements (no movement-based glitches such as windbomb, BLSS, or BTB). The route is intended to prioritize the following assumptions:
- Champions' Ballad will be completed in the early game.
- Epona will be used in the early game, and then the Master Cycle Zero.
- At least two giant ancient cores will be obtained so that an ancient bow and ancient shield can be purchased.
- Hylian Shield durability will be transferred to the ancient shield.
- Corrputed items will be: Rushroom, Wood, Ancient Cores, Beetles, Opal, Lizalfos Tails, and Hearty Bass.
- Wood, Fire, Bomb and Ancient are the arrows that will be corrupted.
- Arrowless breaking of inventory slots.
